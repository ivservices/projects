The "IV Services" social experiment has reached its culmination. One may inquire as to its purpose, duration, and overarching rationale. Originally non-existent, IV Services emerged in response to the proliferation of Elected Admin "Value" bots, prompting a desire to conduct experimentation. To ensure meaningful results, the focus was directed towards addressing a fundamental query posed by players: their response in perilous situations. Recognizing the necessity for engagement, a transition was made from a rudimentary bot to one enriched with lore, supplemented by the implementation of chat logging. Initially, data collection encompassed server popularity, player demographics, group dynamics, and player retention. Subsequently, the incorporation of chat logs facilitated the cultivation of interest among influential figures, albeit for ulterior motives, thus augmenting the bot's prominence beyond ordinary player awareness. Interactions with the user "ValueToTheStars" were orchestrated to bolster the topic's visibility, evident in the adoption of usernames such as "ValueWatch". All operations are conducted internally, utilizing emulators to ensure seamless bot execution. With the conclusion of IV Services imminent, the source code for IV Security and IV Utility will be made publicly accessible. My identity will remain unknown.
